**TL;DR:**
We develop AMRIV, an adaptive, multiply robust estimator for average treatment effect (ATE) estimation when treatment can only be encouraged via a binary instrument. Our method learns an optimal, covariate-dependent assignment policy that minimizes estimator variance, and pairs it with a sequential influence-functionâ€“based estimator that is both semiparametrically efficient and robust to nuisance misspecification. We also provide time-uniform asymptotic confidence sequences and validate the approach in synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments.
